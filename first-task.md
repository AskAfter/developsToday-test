Scalable Error Logging Service - Full-Stack JS Solution

### **Task: Describe the Architecture of an Error Logging Service**

**Overview**

You need to prepare a document describing how you would design an error logging service from scratch. Explain which technologies you would choose for the client library (SDK), backend API, database, web dashboard, and DevOps solution, and justify why these choices are optimal. Additionally, compile a list of questions you would ask the client to better understand the project requirements and expectations.

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **Client SDK** that developers integrate into their applications to capture and send error logs.
2. **API Backend** that receives, processes, and stores logs from client applications.
3. **Web Dashboard** for developers to view, search, and analyze logged errors.
4. **Real-time Alerts** via email notifications on critical errors.
5. **DevOps solution** for scalable deployment, monitoring, and log storage optimization.

### **Additional Task: Developer Questions for the Platform Owner**

As a developer, formulate key questions for the platform owner to clarify requirements and expectations.

### **What You Need to Do:**

- **Describe the application architecture** (SDK, Backend, Database, Web (React) Dashboard, DevOps).
- **Justify your choice of technologies** (why they are suitable for this project).
- **Explain key decisions** (real-time processing, log retention policies, API rate limits, security, DevOps processes).
- **Formulate relevant questions** from a developer's perspective to better understand the project requirements.

====================== SOLUTION =========================

1. Client SDK

I'll use:
JS/TS and Distribute as NPM package.
Purpose:
Capture Frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) errors
Sending logs with context about logs, etc user info, timestamp, environment, stack trace

TypeScript will help with scalable because it gives us safety and IDE support.
It must be small bundle size and async logging
Easy for install for example @error/logger

2. API Backend

Web Framework - Node.js + Express. Because it have high performance and widely using in full-stack JS apps

Realtime Alerts - [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for realtime push from backend to frontend or webhooks to external services.

For email alerts we will use some scalable email delivery like convertic.ai that's give possibility to send interactive emails or more classical service like mailChimp

for background jobs we will use BullMQ + Redis. It is doing great job with queue processing for no blocking errors or alerting and batching

rate limits - express-rate-limit. Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express. Use to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset

I'll do:

RESTful API for receiving logs.
Authentication with API key
Batch log ingestion (e.g., 10-100 logs per request)
Logs pre-processed and stored in DB

Database:

Primary database PostgreSQL will be for structured logs like project -> user -> message

Secondary ClickHouse for analysis like diagrams etc.

Storage - Amazon S3 to save raw JSON, or trace files

3. Web Dashboard

React + Typescript - UI rendering, SPA, type safety

Vite to create

TanStack Query for fetching, pagination

Tailwind CSS will be good because AI tools now better work with it

Charts for diagrams of errors

I'll propose:
Project overview: errors grouped by type, environment etc
Filters: time, project, status etc
Error detail page: stack trace, user steps
Notification settings per project/user

4. Real-time Alerts

Socket.io Client for live updates for new errors.

5. DevOps solution

Containerization - Docker for environment consistency

Orchestrations - Kubernetes or Render and we can use great solution like
Railway. All this solutions gives us scalability

CI/CD - GitGub Actions - Auto-deploy to staging/prod

Monitoring - Prometheus + Grafana for tracking API and system health

Logging - Elastic Stack to view backend logs

Alerting - Slack Webhook to notify on high-level system issues

for all sdk requests we will use API key auth
rate limiting
and background job to archive logs to S3 after some period

Questions:

1. In what platforms do the SDK need to work? (node.js, react native, web?)
2. Do you need multi-tenant support like multiple teams/projects?
3. How many daily active users with average logs are expected?
4. Should alerting be per-user or per-team
5. What error levels will trigger alerts?
6. Do we need roles for users?
7. Do the interface should be adaptive and have dark-mode etc or just functionality?
8. What kind of metrics do you need to must have visualized?
